# Introduction 
I initially struggled with the complete data set from the USGS which was published in 2022 and is the entire Breeding survey from 1966-2021. Not only due to size but also data complexity. So I scaled the project down to the NCRN bird monitoring data over a decade.

# Source
The data I ended up using is the following excel file: [NCRN Bird Monitoring Data 2007 - 2017 ](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncrn-bird-monitoring-data-2007-2017)
