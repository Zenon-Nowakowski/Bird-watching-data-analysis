Description: 
Abstract: The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), which is U.S. Geological Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and Environment Canada, Canadian Wildlife Service, is a primary source of population trend and distribution information for most species of North American birds.  The BBS was initiated in 1966 and continues in 2009. Prior to 1997 the BBS data were captured as 10-stop (survey point) summary data. That is, one species count datum represented the total of that species counted over 10 stops (survey points). In 1997 new technology allowed the program to capture the species count for each point as a separate datum. As resources allow, in recent years the Canadian and US BBS offices have been attempting to enter data from before 1997 on a stop by stop basis. At January, 2009 the Canadian office has entered the pre-1997 data available for Saskatchewan and Alberta. For practical purposes these data will be kept separate from the principle BBS database.

Purpose:  To bring pre-1997 BBS data to the same level of useability as 1997 data.
